# Description
This website is my first attempt at crafting a personal space that reflects my academic journey and individual pursuits -- a visual resume. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I made my website responsive and available in dark and light mode on any user's browser. In addition, I embeded examples of my work such as my personal art projects, comics I created for my highschool's newspaper, Achona Online, and the website of the club I am in, Women in Computing.

# Takeaways

I learned how to use media queries to change the color scheme of my site depending on the user's choice of light or dark mode for their browser. I also learned how to use HTML iFrames in order to embed and showcase certain sites or things I want the user to experience.
