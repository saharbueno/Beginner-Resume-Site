        <h2 id="section1page1">My Home Life</h2>
        <p>My family currently lives in Tampa, Florida. My high school was <a href="https://www.holynamestpa.org/">Academy of the Holy Names</a> which is a Catholic all-girls school. My highschool experience
        was definitely interesting, but I think it definitely prepared me for college. I used to live in South Florida, about an hour away from Miami.
        I loved living near Miami as a lot of my mom's family was there and there was always so much to do, but I also have found
        very good friends and opportunities in Tampa. I also have a dog named Sasha!

        <p>I'm currently a sophomore in college at NYU in the Liberal Studies program. I'm hoping to
            tranfer to CAS to pursue a computer science degree. I chose to do computer science because I feel like
            I can mix my passion for art into it and create things that I can see others use! I'm
            hoping that I can use my computer science knowledge to make a game or website about something I love one day.
            I built a PC myself and am hoping to be able to code cool projects on it.</p>
